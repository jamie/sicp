; a) Write a procedure nmult that takes one argument, a positive integer, and
;    produces the number of multiplications required to raise something to
;    that power using fast-expt.
; b) Can you determine a more concise description of the function computed by
;    the procedure nmult than the program itself?
; c) Show that for n > 1, (nmult n) <= 3 log2(n).
