; The process that a procedure generates is of course dependent on the rules
; used by the interpreter. As an example, consider the iterative gcd procedure
; given above. Suppose we were to interpret this procedure using normal-order
; evaluation, as discussed in section 1.1.5. (The normal-order- evaluation
; rule for if is described in exercise 1.5.) Using the substitution method
; (for normal order), illustrate the process generated in evaluating (gcd 206
; 40) and indicate the remainder operations that are actually performed. How
; many remainder operations are actually performed in the normal-order
; evaluation of (gcd 206 40)? In the applicative-order evaluation?

;      (if (= b 0)
;          a
;          (gcd b (remainder a b))))
