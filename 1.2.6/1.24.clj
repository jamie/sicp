; Modify the timed-prime-test procedure of exercise 1.22 to use fast-prime?
; (the Fermat method), and test each of the 12 primes you found in that
; exercise. Since the Fermat test has O(log n) growth, how would you expect
; the time to test primes near 1,000,000 to compare with the time needed to
; test primes near 1000? Do your data bear this out? Can you explain any
; discrepancy you find?
