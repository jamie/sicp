; The zeroes of the polynomial ax^2 + bx + c are given by -b plus or
; minus sqrt(b^2 - 4ac) times 1/2a. If the discriminant b^2 - 4ac is
; greater than or equal to 0, the roots are both real; otherwise the
; roots are complex with real part -b/2a. Define a procedure 
; smallest-real-part that takes the coefficients a, b and c as arguments
; and returns either the real part of the roots (if theyare complex),
; or else the real root having the smaller absolute value. Be sure
; that your procedure continues to work if some of the coefficients 
; or the discriminant are zero (but you may assume that a is always
; nonzero).
