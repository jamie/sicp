; Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose 
; operators are compound expressions. Use this observation to describe the
; behaviour of the following procedure:
;
; (def a-plus-abs-b [a b]
;   ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))

; (if (> b 0) + -) is a compound expression which returns the name of
; the function to be performed on the arguments.
