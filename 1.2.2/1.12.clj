; The following pattern of numbers is called Pascal's triangle. 
;     1
;    1 1
;   1 2 1
;  1 3 3 1
; 1 4 6 4 1
; The numbers at the edge of the triangle are all 1, and each number inside
; the triangle is the sum of the two numbers above it. Write a procedure
; that computes elements of Pascal's triangle by means of a recursive process.
